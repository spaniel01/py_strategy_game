# Strategy game (Python)
Long-term project to code a strategy game. The game is a basic standard conquest based game in which players move different types of military units, with different attributes, across a map in order to conquer new territories and beat their contenders. They may also build different kinds of buildings in their territories. 

The first step is to code the different classes. The classes to be coded are:
- player
- territory
- military units (infantry, cavalry, artillery)
- buildings (defensive, economic)
